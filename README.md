# us-custom-states-map
This map is created for a specific project in which I hope to create a fill map with multiple layers, one being the regular 50 states + DC, and the second layer splitting several states (Alaska, Illinois, Kentucky, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Washington) to display multiple components.
